Building the project locally
----------------------------

Prerequisities: the following tools have to be installed:
* jdk1.8.0_45 (earlier versions of javac cannot compile the project due to a type inference issue)
* maven 3.x


Steps for building the project:
* clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/everit-org/json-schema.git && cd json-schema/`
* build it with maven: `mvn clean install`
